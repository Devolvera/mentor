# MENTOR
A simple Sails–, Backbone– and Handlebars–powered app for receiving and giving advice.

# Why?
Because I wanted to pretend I was a full–stack developer for a week

# How?
I have no idea, mostly button–bashing, trial and error and late–night tutorial videos

# Thanks
To Ben Howdle for being a mega babe and helping me immensely in my struggles and endeavours to make probably the simplest fucking application known to man.
